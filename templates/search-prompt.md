Verify every publication using an official publisher page and at least one authoritative source such as DOI/Crossref, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, or Web of Science.
Do not invent or infer titles, authors, years, journals, DOIs, methods, or findings; mark unverified information as "Not verified".
Prefer final journal versions, identify duplicate preprint/conference/journal versions, and record explicit exclusion reasons.
Output fields: <Reference, Topic, Journal, Scenario, Model/Method, Data, Objective, Metrics, Findings, Limitations, DOI/URL>.
Separate results into Core Literature, Background Literature, and Pending Verification, and report search strings, search date, sources, and verification statistics.
